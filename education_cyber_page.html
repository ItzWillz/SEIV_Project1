      <h2> Networks and <br>Network Devices</h2>
      <p> In a Computer Science Cybersecurity major, you will learn about the different network devices such as domain name servers, firewalls, and routers. You will also learn
        the various protocols these and other network devices use to communicate information between each other in order to form a network. Most importantly, you will learn about
        secure network and device configurations as well as the importance of network maintenance, network auditing, and physical security.

        <h2> National Cyber League (NCL)</h2>
        <p> 
            As a Computer Science Cybersecurity major, you will take a class in which you will participate in the National Cyber League. The NCL introduces you to the many different concepts 
            in the cybersecurity field and allows you to get hands-on experience. Over the course of class, some of the things you will learn are how to conduct Open Source 
            Intelligence (OSINT), common techniques for encrypting data, and some tools used to monitor network traffic, perform network forensics, and crack passwords.
            In the NCL, you will be able to practice what you have learned in the class in a practical setting.
