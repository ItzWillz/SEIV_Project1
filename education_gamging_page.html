    In a Computer Science Gaming major, you will learn the extensive and more favorable game development engines used throughout
    the trade, for instance, Unity and Unreal Engine. You will also become proficient in both of their respective programming
    languages, C# and C++.

      Some Gaming majors require courses over the design of the game. These include primarily of art courses, such as 3D-Modeling, world building,
      level designing, and more. Learning about design of a game can allow game developers to understand all aspects that go into
      building a game.

      To best be prepared to be a Computer Science Major with Gaming would be to familiarize yourself with the game engines ahead of time.
      Practice making something, follow tutorials on the internet, an excellent beginner series will be linked on the <a href="resources.html"> resources </a>
      page. Also learn more perspectives in game development, because sometimes it will not always be game programming that you will
      have to work on.
